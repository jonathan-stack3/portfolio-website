# Portfolio Progress Journal

## 2025-12-05 — v1.0: First Live Version

- Launched my first personal portfolio website on AWS.
- Built using S3 static hosting + CloudFront + HTTPS + custom domain.
- Added my resume, headshot, and intro content.
- Connected the project to GitHub.
- Learned the full workflow from local machine → S3 → CloudFront → custom domain.
- This is the first version of my real developer portfolio.

**Reflection:**  
This was my first time doing a full cloud deployment end-to-end.  
It made cloud concepts click in a real way.
